NullPointerException is a RuntimeException. In Java, a special null can be assigned to an object reference. NullPointerException is thrown when an application attempts to use an object reference, having the null value. These include:

Calling an instance method on the object referred by a null reference.
Accessing or modifying an instance field of the object referred by a null reference.
If the reference type is an array type, taking the length of a null reference.
If the reference type is an array type, accessing or modifying the slots of a null reference.
If the reference type is a subtype of Throwable, throwing a null reference.
Applications should throw instances of this class to indicate other illegal uses of the null object.
