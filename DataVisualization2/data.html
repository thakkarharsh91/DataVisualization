			<h3 align = "left">Crawling</h2>
			<p>The crawling process can be explained in the few steps as under: </p>
			<ul>
			<li>The wikibooks java programming link has number of sections in one single page.</li>
			<li>The first page contains mostly the links to all the sub links. These sublinks are about the features of wiki java programming book as well as about the technical aspects of Java programming</li>
			<li>Initially with the help of Jsoup library, the first page is crawled and links of all the pages are taken.</li>
			<li>Now these links are taken as input and the data for these links is exracted in the form of text and stored in one text file.</li>
			<li>Now since the page is very big, it is not good method to store the data of entire page in just one file. So by further research, the knowledge is gained on the tags under the div section.</li>
			<li>After closely observing most of the links, it was known that paragraph and the bullet points were maximum in most of the pages.</li>
			<li>Adding all the paragraphs of one page in one file and all bullet points in one page also would lead to big text file which might lead to incorrect indexing.</li>
			<li>After detailed analysis, it was known that storing information of 5 tags of a particular file leads to precise and correct indexing and the correct recommendation system.</li>
			<li>Once the crawling program is run, all the crawled files are stored in CrawledFiles folder created in C:.</li>
			<li>Also keeping in mind the bonus points, the crawling and Indexing is also done on the Oracle tuorials webpage.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 align = "left">Indexing</h2>
			<p>The indexing process can be explained in the few steps as under: </p>
			<ul>
			<li>The indexing process takes all the crawled files as input and runs the indexing algorithm on them.</li>
			<li>The Lucene library is taken into consideration for the Indexing of the files.</li>
			<li>While indexing, the stemming is also used in the project so that all the occurences of a particular word can be searched in the indexed files. The PorterStemmer class is used for this purpose.</li>
			<li>The indexing process returns the top 10 hits for one particular post of StackOverflow data.</li>
			<li>Once the Indexing process is run, the Indexed files are stored in IndexedFiles folder in C:.</li>
